85	85	ผู้ป่วย เป็น acute pyelonephritis แพทย์ทำ ultrasound พบ Hydronephrosis ควรให้รหัส N10 ร่วมกับ N13.6 หรือ N 13.6 อย่างเดียวคะ	ถ้าแพทย์สรุปว่ามีโรคร่วมเป็น Hydronephrosis ก็ให้รหัส N10 Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis เป็นโรค หลักและ N13.6 Pyonephrosis เป็นโรคร่วมครับ แต่ถ้าแพทย์ไม่เขียน Hydronephrosis เป็นโรคร่วม ก็อาจใช้ N10 รหัส เดียวครับ	1
86	86	ผู้ป่วย thalassemia มา admit ด้วย hct. 22 ได้รับ PRC 2 UNIT ควรให้รหัส thalasssemia เป็น รหัสวินิจฉัยหลัก หรือ รหัส anemia เป็นรหัสวินิจฉัยหลัก 	ให้แพทย์สรุปมาก่อนว่าอะไรเป็นโรคหลัก แล้วให้รหัสตามที่แพทย์สรุป	1
87	87	อยากทราบวิธีการลงรหัสในหมวด Z จะมีผลต่อ DRG หรือไม่ เช่น ผู้ป่วย CA colon S/P Surgery with colostomy admit เพื่อรับยาเคมีบำบัด แต่รอบcolostomyมีอักเสบเป็น หนอง ต้องให้ศัลยแพทย์ตรวจและให้การดูแลรักษาทั้งแผลที่ติดเชื้อ และ colostomy care มันประวัติบิดาเป็น CA colon มาก่อน นอกจากการลงรหัส chemotherapy session แล้ว การลงว่า attention of colostomy(code Z) เป็นโรคร่วม และมีการเปลี่ยน colostomy เป็นหัตถการ และลง family history of colon cancer (code Z) จะมีผลต่อ DRG หรือไม่ การลง code Z อย่างไร จึงมีผลต่อ DRG เนื่องจาก admission หนึ่งมักดูแลผู้ป่วยนอกเหนือไปจากการให้ยาเคมีบำบัด อยากให้ช่วยตอบด้วย หรือที่มีผลมากจะเป็นเฉพาะ code chemotherapy session กับ radiation session เท่านั้น 	การให้รหัส Z หลายๆรหัสร่วมกัน ไม่ทำให้การคำนวณ DRG แตกต่างกัน	1
88	88	ผู้ป่วยเป็น Advanced stage of squamous cell carcinoma of larynx มี Tumor lysis syndrome ไม่ทราบว่าจะให้รหัสอะไรบ้างคะ	ให้รหัส C32.9 Malignant neoplasm of larynx และรหัส M8010/3 Sqaumous cell carcinoma	1
89	89	ผู้ป่วยเบาหวานอายุมากกว่า 70 ปี ต้องมาฉีดอินสุลีน ทุกวัน จะให้รหัส E119 หรือ E109 ดี เพราะแพทย์เคยแย้งว่า จะต้องดูอายุผู้ป่วยเป็นหลัก	ให้แพทย์เขียนว่าผู้ป่วยเป็นเบาหวานชนิดอะไร แล้วให้รหัสตามที่แพทย์เขียน	1
90	90	sequelae from ischemic stroke ให้รหัสโรคอะไร	ให้รหัส I69.3	1
92	92	ถ้าแพทย์ Dx.DM type II with hyperglycemia เท่านั้น (โดยไม่มีcoma) ควรให้รหัสใด	Hyperglycemia เป็นอาการของเบาหวานไม่ต้องให้รหัสอะไรเพิ่มเติม ใช้รหัส E11.9 รหัสเดียว	1
93	93	แพทย์สรุป Chart เป็น Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease with Acute exacerbation due to lower respiratory infection จะให้รหัสเป็น J441 เป็น Pdx แล้วให้รหัส J22 เป็น โรคร่วม หรือว่าให้รหัส J440 เพียงรหัสเดียวก็พอ	แพทย์สรุปไม่ดี เพราะเขียนหลายโรคเป็นโรคหลัก ควรให้แพทย์เขียนใหม่ โดยให้บอกว่า lower respiratory infection เป็นโรคอะไร เช่น ปอดบวม หรือ หลอดลมอักเสบ แล้วค่อยให้รหัส J44.0 คู่กับรหัสโรคที่แพทย์เขียน	1
94	94	แพทย์วินิจฉัย Acute bronchitis การให้รหัสในกลุ่มเด็ก/ผู้ใหญ่ ต่างกันอย่างไร	ไม่ต่างกัน	1
95	95	Kennedy diseases ควรให้รหัสอะไร	คือโรค Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ให้รหัส G12.1	1
96	96	ขอทราบรหัส RAD reactive airway disease ใช้รหัส J 68.3 หรือ J 98.8 หรือ J 45.2 หรือ J 44.2 สับสนมากเลยค่ะ	ใช้รหัส J68.3 Other acute and subacute respiratory conditions due to chemicals, gases, fumes and vapours	1
110	8	กรณีแรกรับ fully dilated คลอดเลย ประวัติ preterm ให้รหัส O60.1 ถูกต้องหรือไม่ (Term by Ballard score)	คงยังจำได้ว่าในการสรุปจำหน่ายให้สรุปโรคที่เป็นการวินิจฉัยขั้นสุดท้าย (Final diagnosis) ดังนั้นถ้าหากผล การทำ Ballard score ได้เป็นเด็กครบกำหนด ก็คงสรุปว่าเป็น preterm ไม่ได้ แม้ประวัติประจำเดือนจะบ่งว่า คลอดก่อนกำหนดก็ตาม กรณีนี้ให้รหัสเหมือนการคลอดปกติครบกำหนดครับ	2
97	97	ผู้ป่วย Pancytopenia ให้การรักษาเฉพาะ Anemia (ให้เลือด) และ Neutropenia (ให้ Neupogen) ส่วน Thrombocytopenia ไม่ได้รักษา จะให้วินิจฉัยว่า Pancytopenia หรือ Anemia + Neutropenia	เข้าใจว่าผู้ถามน่าจะเป็นคุณหมอ อย่าไปคิดว่าวินิจฉัยได้เฉพาะโรคที่รักษาครับ ถ้าคุณหมอเห็นว่าเป็น Pancytopenia ถึงแม้จะรักษาแค่ 2 เรื่อง ก็ให้การวินิจฉัยว่า Pancytopenia ได้นี่ครับ เพราะการที่ผู้ป่วยมีเกล็ดเลือดต่ำก็น่าจะทำให้ผู้ป่วยมีความเสี่ยงต่อการเกิดอันตรายจากเลือดออก ไม่ต้องรอจนมีการให้เกล็ดเลือดเสียก่อนถึงจะวินิจฉัยได้	1
98	98	กรณี node metastasis มารับยาเคมีบำบัดแล้วยุบ ในการรับยาครั้งต่อไปคลำไม่พบ node แล้ว ยังคงให้รหัสของ secondary malignancy เป็นการวินิจฉัยหลักหรือไม่	ใช่ครับ เพราะการรักษายังไม่สิ้นสุด ถึงแม้ต่อมน้ำเหลืองจะยุบแล้ว	1
99	99	พบแพทย์สรุปโรคหลักว่า Viral infection มาก ใช้รหัส B34.9 ได้หรือไม่ เห็นเคยบอกว่าไม่ควรสรุปว่า Bacterial infection	ในแง่ของผู้ให้รหัส ถ้าไม่อยากให้รหัส B34.9 Viral infection, unspecified ก็ควรไปปรึกษาคุณหมอว่าท่านพอจะกรุณาวินิจฉัยให้ละเอียดกว่านี้ได้ไหม เพราะมีคุณค่าทางเวชสถิติต่ำต้อยเหลือเกิน ถ้าทำบุญมาดีคุณหมออาจจะยอมเปลี่ยนคำวินิจฉัยครับ แต่ถ้าท่านยังยืนกรานก็ยอมให้รหัส B34.9 ไปเถอะครับ	1
100	100	Urinoma หมายถึงอะไร ให้รหัสอะไร	คำว่า urinoma หมายถึงถุงน้ำหรือก้อนที่ภายในเป็นน้ำปัสสาวะ ตามทฤษฎีเกิดจากการรั่วของน้ำปัสสาวะจากส่วนใดส่วนหนึ่งของทางเดินปัสสาวะ อาจจะเป็นไต กระเพาะปัสสาวะ หรือท่อไต ไปสะสมกันอยู่หลังเยื่อบุช่องท้อง ซึ่งภาวะนี้อยู่ดีๆ คงไม่เกิดขึ้นได้เอง น่าจะต้องมีเหตุนำมาก่อนสักอย่าง เช่น ได้รับบาดเจ็บ หรือได้รับการผ่าตัด อย่างไรก็ตามในทางปฏิบัติ โดยเฉพาะอย่างยิ่งในประเทศไทยของเรา คุณหมอบางท่านอาจใช้คำนี้เป็นศัพท์แสลง (คล้ายกับ paraffinoma) หมายถึงกระเพาะปัสสาวะที่มีน้ำปัสสาวะเต็ม อาจเกิดจากการกลั้นปัสสาวะ หรือมีปัญหาในการถ่ายปัสสาวะ ทำให้กระเพาะปัสสาวะโตขึ้นชัดเจน จนคลำได้เป็นถุงน้ำอยู่ในอุ้งเชิงกราน บางครั้งพบในผู้ป่วยที่ใส่สายสวนปัสสาวะคาไว้ แต่สายสวนดันถูกกดทับ ทำให้น้ำปัสสาวะไหลออกมาตามสายไม่ได้ อาจทำให้เข้าใจผิดว่าเป็นถุงน้ำรังไข่ จนเอาไปทำผ่าตัดก็มีมาแล้ว ภาวะนี้สามารถพิสูจน์ทราบได้ง่ายๆ โดยให้ถ่ายปัสสาวะ หรือสวนปัสสาวะทิ้ง แล้วตรวจซ้ำ จะพบว่าถุงน้ำนี้หายไปคงต้องถามคุณหมอครับ ว่าท่านหมายถึงอะไรกันแน่	1
101	101	ผู้ป่วยอายุ 50 ปี มาด้วยอาการท้องเสียเรื้อรัง แพทย์สรุปว่า chronic watery diarrhea ให้รหัส K52.9 ถูกต้องหรือไม่	ไม่ถูกต้องแน่นอนครับ รหัส K52.9 Noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified ใช้ต่อเมื่อแพทย์วินิจฉัยว่าภาวะท้องเสียหรือท้องเดินไม่ได้เกิดจากการติดเชื้อ (noninfective) เท่านั้น ในผู้ป่วยรายนี้แพทย์มิได้ระบุว่าเกิดจากการติดเชื้อหรือไม่ ควรให้รหัส A09.9 Gastroenteritis and colitis of unspecified origin ครับ	1
102	102	ผู้ป่วย left dermoid cyst ผ่าตัดพบ nodule ที่ round ligament ทำผ่าตัด left SO with biopsy round ligament ผลพยาธิที่ round ligament เป็น Hyalinized fibromuscular nodule with calcification ให้รหัส ICD-10 รหัสใด สำหรับ nodule ที่ round ligament	ให้รหัสไม่ถูกเพราะผู้ถามไม่บอกมาด้วยว่าคุณหมอสรุปว่าอย่างไร อย่าไปให้รหัสเอาเองจากผลพยาธิวิทยาถ้าแพทย์ไม่สรุปครับ กลับไปให้คุณหมอสรุปก่อน 	1
103	1	ผู้ป่วยมาขอให้ฉีดยากระตุ้นไข่สุกโดยนำยามาเอง ให้รหัสอะไร โรงพยาบาล 30 เตียงไม่มีแพทย์เฉพาะทาง	ต้องถามกลับไปว่าคุณหมอที่โรงพยาบาล (กี่เตียงก็ช่าง และไม่จำเป็นต้องเป็นแพทย์เฉพาะทาง) วินิจฉัยว่าอะไร ก็ให้รหัสการวินิจฉัยไปตามนั้นแหละครับ ส่วนรหัสหัตถการฉีดยาไม่ต้องให้ ที่น่ากลัวก็คืออย่าได้ให้บริการฉีดยาโดยไม่ผ่านคุณหมอเสียก่อน ไม่งั้นเกิดแพ้ยาขึ้นมาจะเอาไม่อยู่	2
104	2	Polycythemia ในทารกแรกเกิดให้รหัสอะไร	นี่ถ้าผู้ถามเปิดหนังสือ Index ซะหน่อยก็คงไม่เสียเวลาถามคำถามนี้ ลองเปิดดูครับ หนังสือ ICD-10-TM ปี 2012 เล่ม 2 หน้า 224 คอลัมน์ขวามือ ใช้ Polycythemia เป็นคำหลัก และ neonatorum เป็นคำขยาย จะพบรหัส P61.1 Polycythemia neonatorum ตรวจสอบรหัสนี้กับหนังสือ ICD-10-TM ปี 2012 เล่ม 1 หน้า 487 จะเห็นว่ารหัสนี้เป็นรหัสสำหรับภาวะเลือดข้นในทารกแรกเกิด 	2
105	3	คนไข้ท้อง มาด้วยอาการเจ็บท้อง อายุครรภ์ 15 สัปดาห์ ด้วยสาเหตุท้องกระแทกราวจับที่นั่งบนรถเมล์ แพทย์วินิจฉัย Incomplete abortion จะให้รหัส Injury และ External cause อย่างไร	ผู้ถามคงดูละครโทรทัศน์มากไปหน่อย ธรรมชาติสร้างเกราะปกป้องทารกในครรภ์ไว้หลายชั้น สุภาพสตรีบางท่านยังสร้าง Air bag ที่หน้าท้องเสริมเข้าไปอีก ท้องกระแทกราวจับที่นั่งบนรถเมล์ไม่ทำให้ แท้งได้หรอกครับ นอกจากจะรุนแรงจนมดลูกแตก ซึ่งรายนี้คงไม่ถึงขนาดนั้น เพราะแพทย์ก็วินิจฉัยว่า Incomplete abortion เท่านั้น ไม่ได้วินิจฉัยสักนิดเลยว่ามีการบาดเจ็บ ทำไมไม่เชื่อแพทย์ล่ะครับ	2
106	4	ถ้าแพทย์วินิจฉัย Threatened preterm labor ในผู้ป่วยอายุครรภ์ 33 wk ไม่มีการใช้ยาใดๆ และกลับบ้านจะให้รหัสอะไร	น่าจะมีการเข้าใจผิดอะไรสักอย่าง ตั้งแต่ผู้เขียนเป็นสูติแพทย์มากว่า 30 ปีเพิ่งจะเห็นคำวินิจฉัยว่า Threatened preterm labor วันนี้แหละครับ มีแต่ Threatened abortion ที่แปลว่าแท้งคุกคาม นี่คงจะให้แปลว่าเจ็บครรภ์ก่อนกำหนดคุกคามกระมัง แล้วมันคุกคามอย่างไรล่ะ ยอมรับว่าไม่รู้จักคำวินิจฉัยนี้ครับ แต่จากคำถามที่ส่งมาบอกว่าไม่มีการใช้ยาใดๆ และกลับบ้านได้ ก็น่าจะแปลว่าไม่มีอาการผิดปกติใดๆ ไม่มี uterine contraction และคงไม่ใช่ False labor สรุปว่าถ้าไม่ได้เป็นอะไรก็ไม่มีรหัสครับ	2
107	5	ตั้งครรภ์ 35 สัปดาห์ เจ็บท้องคลอด คลอดก่อนกำหนด มี tear มี anemia ให้อะไรเป็นรหัสการวินิจฉัยหลัก	โรคที่มีความรุนแรงที่สุดที่ทำให้ต้องรับไว้ในโรงพยาบาลครั้งนี้คือการเจ็บครรภ์ก่อนกำหนดซึ่งทำให้คลอด ก่อนกำหนด ตรงกับรหัส O60.1 Preterm spontaneous labor with preterm delivery น่าจะให้รหัสนี้แหละเป็น รหัสการวินิจฉัยหลัก ส่วน anemia เป็นการวินิจฉัยร่วมเพราะไม่รุนแรงถึงกับต้องรับไว้ เพียงแต่ติดตัวมาด้วยเท่านั้น และ tear ก็เกิดขึ้นภายหลัง จึงเป็นโรคแทรกครับ อย่าลืมให้รหัสสำหรับ Mode of delivery และ Outcome of delivery ด้วยนะครับ	2
108	6	MBA แพทย์เขียนตัวย่อมา สอบถามไปแพทย์บอกว่าเป็นการขูดมดลูกเอารกออกด้วยมือ เป็นการเข้า OR ใช้รหัสขูดมดลูกได้เลยหรือเปล่า	ผู้ตอบคิดว่า MBA ย่อมาจาก Master of business administration คือปริญญาโททางบริหารธุรกิจ คงไม่ เกี่ยวกับการให้รหัสโรค การเอารกออกด้วยมือเขาเรียกว่า “ล้วงรก” ครับ เพราะใช้มือล้วงหรือควักออกมา ตรงกับ ภาษาอังกฤษว่า Manual removal of placenta มักทำในห้องคลอด แต่ถ้าจะทำในห้องผ่าตัดก็ไม่ขัดข้อง ส่วนการ ขูด มดลูกที่เรียกว่า Curettage นั้นต้องใช้เครื่องมือขูด	2
109	7	หญิงมีเลือดออกจากช่องคลอด ไปโรงพยาบาลศูนย์ admit ขูดมดลูก กลับมายังมีเลือดออกอยู่ มา admit ที่โรงพยาบาลชุมชน 2 วัน นอนดูอาการ ไม่มีเลือดออกจึงจำหน่ายกลับบ้าน หลังกลับไป 3 วันมีเลือดออกทางช่องคลอด 20 ผืน/วัน กลับมาแพทย์ขูดมดลูกซ้ำ ไม่พบเศษรก วินิจฉัย Post curettage vaginal bleeding ต้องให้รหัสอะไร	เข้าใจว่าผู้ถามคงอยู่ที่โรงพยาบาลชุมชน ข้อมูลในคำถามน่าจะยังไม่ครบ ควรทบทวนหาข้อมูลเพื่มเติมว่าในการขูด มดลูกครั้งหลังแพทย์ได้ส่งชิ้นเนื้อตรวจหรือไม่ ถ้าส่งตรวจผลเป็นอย่างไร แล้วขอให้แพทย์บันทึกการวินิจฉัยที่ละเอียดยิ่งขึ้น ว่าอะไรเป็นสาเหตุทำให้เลือดออก ถ้าไม่มีข้อมูลนี้คงต้องให้รหัส N93.9 Abnormal uterine and vaginal bleeding, unspecified ส่วนเรื่องราวที่โรงพยาบาลศูนย์เป็นเรื่องของโรงพยาบาลศูนย์	2
122	20	ทารกอายุ 2 เดือน มาตรวจร่างกายและฉีดวัคซีน ให้รหัสการตรวจสุขภาพ Z00.1 ร่วมกับรหัสการฉีดวัคซีนหรือไม่	ให้เฉพาะรหัสการฉีดวัคซีนครับ แพทย์ที่โรงพยาบาลของผู้ถามไม่ยอมตรวจร่างกายเด็กทารก ก่อนฉีดวัคซีนหรือครับ	2
111	9	เมื่อมี Guidelines ใหม่ออกมา เล่มเก่ายกเลิกเลยหรือไม่ กรณี mild PIH version 2007 ใช้ O13 แต่เล่มใหม่ใช้ O14.0	เมื่อมีการประกาศใช้ Standard coding guidelines ฉบับใด จะมีประกาศยกเลิกฉบับก่อนหน้านั้นไปพร้อมกันครับ ส่วนคำถามเกี่ยวกับ PIH (Pregnancy-induced hypertension) ผู้ถามน่าจะยังเข้าใจคลาดเคลื่อน ขอชี้แจงว่า รหัส O13 ใช้เมื่อแพทย์วินิจฉัยว่าเป็น Pregnancy-induced hypertension ที่ไม่มี Proteinuria ไม่มีการแบ่งเป็น mild หรือ severe ส่วนรหัส O14.- ใช้เมื่อแพทย์วินิจฉัยว่าเป็น Pregnancy-induced hypertension ที่มี Proteinuria ซึ่งมักเรียกว่า Pre-eclampsia แบ่งออกเป็น mild pre-eclampsia (O14.0) และ severe pre-eclampsia (O14.1) หลักการนี้อยู่ใน Standard coding guidelines ทั้งฉบับ 2008 และ 2011 ไม่ทราบว่าผู้ถามได้ฉบับ 2007 มาจากไหน	2
112	10	กรณี Missed abortion 15 wk รับไว้เหน็บ Cytotec หรือ drip Syntocinon พยาบาลช่วยคลอด (เปิด set คลอด) ให้ Pdx: O03.9 และ Proc: 73.59 เหมือนคลอดปกติ ถูกต้องหรือไม่	ไม่ถูกต้องครับ เข้าใจว่ารายนี้แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า Missed abortion ต้องให้รหัสโรคหลักเป็น O02.1 ตาม แพทย์ครับ ไม่ใช่ O03.9 ส่วนรหัสหัตถการไม่ใช้ 73.59 เพราะไม่ใช่การคลอด ถึงพยาบาลจะเปิด set คลอดก็ตาม	2
113	11	รหัส O24.4 Diabetes mellitus arising in pregnancy วัดค่าระดับน้ำตาลที่เท่าไร การกินกลูโคสต้องเจาะเลือดหลังกิน 1 หรือ 2 ชั่วโมง ค่าปกติอยู่ที่เท่าไร	การวินิจฉัยโรคนี้เป็นดุลพินิจของคุณหมอที่ดูแลผู้ป่วย ไม่ต้องไปช่วยคุณหมอวินิจฉัย ผู้ให้รหัสต้องเชื่อมั่น ว่า คุณหมอวินิจฉัยถูกต้องครับ	2
114	12	เด็กหญิงอายุ 13 ปี ญาติพามาตรวจร่างกาย แจ้งว่าถูกข่มขืน ผลการตรวจร่างกายไม่มีร่องรอยแผลหรือการบาดเจ็บ (เหตุเกิดมาหลายวันแล้ว) แต่มีรอยฉีกขาดเดิมของเยื่อพรหมจรรย์ (เหตุผลการตรวจ ญาติต้องการเอาผิดฝ่ายชาย โดยความจริงเด็กมีการสมยอมกันเอง) มีส่ง Acid phosphatase ผลไม่พบอสุจิ	รู้สึกว่ารายนี้จะซักประวัติได้ละเอียดมาก ถึงกับทราบว่าสมยอมกัน ยังกะไปนั่งดูอยู่ด้วย กรณีนี้ให้รหัส Z04.4 Examination and observation following alleged rape and seduction หมายถึงการตรวจหลังจากอ้าง ว่า ถูกข่มขืน จริงหรือเท็จไม่ทราบ สังเกตคำว่า alleged ซึ่งหมายถึงอ้างว่าหรือกล่าวหาว่า เพราะผลการตรวจของ แพทย์จะไม่สรุปว่าข่มขืนหรือไม่ คดีนี้จำเลยมีสิทธิติดคุกครับ เพราะเด็กอายุแค่ 13 ปี	2
115	13	ผู้ป่วย C/S with TR ด้วย indication breech presentation (จากอัลตราซาวด์ 2 วันก่อนผ่า) ขณะผ่าตัดเป็นท่าหัว ให้การวินิจฉัยหลักอะไร	การวินิจฉัยหลักให้ใช้การวินิจฉัยขั้นสุดท้ายครับ ถ้าลงเอยว่าไม่ใช่ท่าก้นก็คงวินิจฉัยว่าท่าก้นไม่ได้ ในกรณี นี้ เด็กมีหัวเป็นส่วนนำถือว่าปกติ ต้องดูวิธีคลอดว่าเป็นการผ่าแบบ elective หรือ emergency แล้วให้วิธีการคลอด เป็นการวินิจฉัยหลักแทน 	2
116	14	โรงพยาบาลชุมชนรับผู้ป่วยตั้งครรภ์ 36 สัปดาห์ มี contraction เพื่อให้ยาลด contraction แต่ไม่สำเร็จ ยังมี contraction ตลอด ต้อง refer ไปโรงพยาบาลศูนย์ ให้รหัสอะไร	เข้าใจว่า refer เพราะ Preterm labor แต่ยังไม่คลอด ใช้รหัส O60.0 Preterm labor without delivery ครับ แต่สงสัยว่าอายุครรภ์ตั้ง 36 สัปดาห์แล้ว ไปให้ยาลด contraction ทำไม คุณหมอทราบไหมว่าเขาเลิกให้เมื่อ อายุครรภ์มากกว่า 34 สัปดาห์	2
123	21	ผู้ป่วยชาย แต่แปลงเพศเป็นหญิงมาหลายปีแล้ว แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่าช่องคลอดอักเสบ ถูกข่มขืนมา ให้รหัสอะไร	กรณีช่องคลอดอักเสบให้รหัส N76.0 Acute vaginitis เหมือนผู้ป่วยหญิงครับ รหัสนี้ไม่ได้ระบุว่าใช้กับ ช่องคลอดจริงหรือช่องคลอดเทียม ขอให้แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่าช่องคลอดอักเสบก็ใช้ได้ ส่วนการถูกข่มขืนให้รหัสสาเหตุ ภายนอก Y05.- Sexual assault by bodily force ซึ่งใช้ได้กับทั้งสองเพศอยู่แล้ว ปัญหาน่าจะอยู่ที่จะระบุว่าเป็น เพศใดมากกว่า	2

118	16	มารดาตั้งครรภ์ 39 สัปดาห์ มาด้วยไข้หนาวสั่น UA มี WBC 50 – 100 แพทย์วินิจฉัย Acute pyelonephritis หลัง admit มีอาการเจ็บครรภ์ แพทย์รักษาด้วยการยับยั้งการคลอด ควรให้รหัสอย่างไร	ในคำถามนี้ไม่ได้ระบุว่ายับยั้งการคลอดสำเร็จหรือไม่ ถ้าสำเร็จ หมายถึงจำหน่ายกลับบ้านโดยไม่คลอด ให้ รหัสการวินิจฉัยหลัก O23.0 Infections of kidney in pregnancy ซึ่งเป็นรหัสที่ไม่สมบูรณ์ ต้องให้รหัส N10 Acute tubule-interstitial nephritis เป็นรหัสการวินิจฉัยร่วม แต่ถ้ายับยั้งไม่สำเร็จก็ต้องเพิ่มรหัสสำหรับวิธีคลอด ผลของการคลอด และโรคแทรก (ถ้ามี) ส่วนรหัส O60.- ไม่ต้องให้ เพราะรายนี้ครรภ์ครบกำหนดแล้ว ที่ผู้ตอบ สงสัยคือแนวทางการรักษาของคุณหมอ ไปยับยั้งการคลอดด้วยเหตุผลใดครับ ธรรมชาติอุตส่าห์หาทางแก้ปัญหา โดยสั่งการให้เจ็บท้องเองแล้ว จะรอให้ทารกเป็นอันตรายในครรภ์หรืออย่างไร	2
119	17	มารดาตั้งครรภ์ 39 สัปดาห์เศษ เจ็บท้องคลอด ระหว่างรอคลอดตรวจพบ FHS ผิดปกติ แพทย์จึงทำผ่าตัดฉุกเฉิน แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า Fetal compromise คืออะไร	คำถามนี้น่าจะถามคุณหมอที่เป็นคนวินิจฉัยนะครับ คำว่า compromise เป็นทั้งคำนามและกิริยา แปลว่า ยอมความ ประนีประนอม รอมชอมกัน ผ่อนหนักผ่อนเบาให้กัน ยอมอ่อนข้อให้กัน ยอมถอยคนละก้าว หรือใน สมัยนี้อาจแปลว่าปรองดองกัน ในกรณีของทารกในครรภ์น่าจะหมายถึงทารกปรับตัวเข้ากับสภาวะเลวร้ายในครรภ์ (เช่น สายสะดือถูกกด) ได้ อาจตรวจพบว่าอัตราการเต้นของหัวใจทารกเร็วกว่าปกติเล็กน้อย เป็นอาการที่อาจ หายไปเอง คงอยู่จนคลอด หรือกลายเป็นภาวะ Uncompromised หรือ Fetal distress ซึ่งในเวลานั้นอัตราการเต้น ของหัวใจทารกจะช้ากว่าปกติ แสดงว่าแย่แล้ว สู้ไม่ไหวแล้ว หรือปรองดองไม่ไหวแล้ว ปล่อยทิ้งไว้คงต้องตายไปข้าง หนึ่ง (มักเป็นทารกตาย) ภาวะ Fetal compromise ไม่มีรหัส เพราะถือว่ายังไม่ใช่โรคหรือความผิดปกติ ยังเอาอยู่ ดังนั้นในรายนี้ถ้ามีข้อมูลเพียงเท่านี้ รหัสการวินิจฉัยหลักคือ O82.1 Delivered by emergency cesarean section ครับ แต่ถ้าคุณหมอเปลี่ยนคำวินิจฉัยเป็น Fetal bradycardia หรือ Fetal tachycardia จะได้รหัสการ วินิจฉัยหลัก O68.0 Labor and delivery complicated by fetal heart rate anomaly	2
120	18	กรณีที่ผู้ป่วยคลอดปกติ ไม่ตัดฝีเย็บ รหัสหัตถการจะต้องใช้ 73.59 หรือไม่	รหัสหัตถการ 73.59 Other manually assisted delivery หมายถึง การช่วยทำคลอดที่นอกเหนือจากการ ใช้ มือหมุนศีรษะทารก ซึ่งใช้รหัส 73.51 Manual rotation of fetal head ในการช่วยทำคลอดอาจจะมีการตัดฝี เย็บรวมอยู่ด้วยหรือไม่ก็ได้ แล้วแต่ความจำเป็น แม้จะเป็น Non-OR procedure แต่ก็เป็นหัตถการที่ต้องการทักษะ ชั้นสูง ฝึกกันนานกว่าจะทำได้ จำเป็นต้องให้ครับ	2

125	23	คนไข้มา admit คลอดให้รหัสอะไร	ผู้ถามคงหมายถึงรหัสสำหรับผู้ป่วยนอก ไม่ต้องให้รหัสผู้ป่วยนอกครับ เพราะได้รับไว้เป็นผู้ป่วยในแล้ว ปัญหานี้น่าจะหมดมานานแล้ว เพราะกระทรวงสาธารณสุขได้ชี้แจงมาร่วม 10 ปีเห็นจะได้ แสดงว่าโรงพยาบาลของผู้ถาม ตั้งอยู่หลังเขา และน่าจะไม่เคย update โปรแกรมคอมพิวเตอร์	2
126	24	Pregnancy หลัง TR มีรหัสใดที่ใช้ได้บ้าง	ผู้ถามคงหมายถึงรหัสสำหรับระบุว่าหญิงคนนี้เคยทำหมันแล้ว ไม่มีรหัสครับ ให้รหัสเหมือนหญิงตั้งครรภ์ ทั่วไป	2

130	28	ผู้ป่วยนอก มาฟังผล Pap smear ได้ผล abnormal จะวินิจฉัยอย่างไร และให้รหัสอะไร	ให้การวินิจฉัยตามผล Pap smear ที่ผิดปกติสิครับ เขาคงไม่ report แค่ abnormal Pap เป็นแน่ แล้วให้รหัสตามการวินิจฉัยนั้น รหัส 5 หลักของผล Pap smear ที่ผิดปกติอยู่ในหนังสือ ICD-10-TM เล่ม 1 ในกลุ่มรหัส R87.- Abnormal findings in specimen from female genital organs	2

133	31	Normal labor with episiotomy with 2nd degree tear ต้องให้รหัสหัตถการ 75.69 Repair of other current obstetric laceration หรือไม่	ประเด็นแรกคงต้องย้อนไปดูข้อมูลที่แท้จริงของผู้ป่วยรายนี้ว่ามี 2nd degree tear จริงหรือไม่ คำว่า 2nd degree tear หมายถึงมีการฉีกขาดของชั้นกล้ามเนื้อฝีเย็บหรือกล้ามเนื้อช่องคลอดที่นอกเหนือจากการตัดฝีเย็บ กรณี กล้ามเนื้อฝีเย็บฉีกขาดจากการตัด (episiotomy) ไม่นับว่าเป็น tear ประเด็นที่สองรหัส 75.69 ใช้สำหรับการเย็บ ซ่อมแซมการฉีกขาดที่นอกเหนือจากการตัดฝีเย็บ	2

136	34	แพทย์สรุปโรคหลัก Abortion โรคร่วม Anemia มีหัตถการให้เลือด รหัสที่ให้ O06.1, O08.1 หรือ O06.1, O99.0, D62	รหัสไม่ถูกต้องทั้งสองแบบที่ให้มาครับ ถ้าข้อมูลมีเพียงเท่านี้รหัสโรคหลักคือ O06.9 Unspecified abortion, complete or unspecified, without complication และรหัสโรคร่วมคือ O99.0 Anemia complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium	2
137	35	เด็กแรกเกิด BBA และมี Breast milk neonatal jaundice ให้รหัส P59.8 กับ Z38.1 ถูกต้องหรือไม่	ยังไม่ถูกต้องครับ ถ้าแพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า breast milk jaundice ให้รหัส P59.3 Neonatal jaundice from breast milk inhibitor ส่วนรหัส P59.8 Neonatal jaundice from other specified causes ให้ในกรณีที่แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า breast feeding jaundice ส่วนรหัส Z38.1 ให้ถูกแล้วครับ	2
138	36	ตกเลือดจากการคลอด แพทย์สรุปว่า Normal delivery และ Anemia from acute blood loss มีหัตถการให้เลือด ต้องให้รหัส Anemia ด้วยหรือไม่	แพทย์สรุปไม่ถูกต้องตามข้อมูลครับ ตกเลือดจากการคลอดคือ intrapartum hemorrhage	2
139	37	ขอเรียนถามเกี่ยวกับรหัส O62 Acute post-hemorrhagic anemia (1) จะใช้รหัสนี้เมื่อขณะ admit รอบนั้นมีภาวะ bleeding แล้ว แต่มีประวัติ bleeding เมื่อไม่นานมานี้ใช่หรือไม่ (2) ถ้าขณะ admit รอบนั้นมีภาวะ bleeding ด้วย เช่น UGIB ทำไมถึงให้รหัส D62 ไม่ได้ ทั้งที่ในหนังสือระบุ ว่า D62 ใช้กับประวัติเสียเลือดอย่างเฉียบพลัน (3) ถ้ามีการรักษาเพียงในทาน FBC ไม่ได้ให้เลือด จะให้รหัส D62 ได้หรือไม่ (4) ภาวะเลือดออกมากในขณะผ่าตัด มี Hct drop ให้ PRC จะให้รหัส Anemia เป็นรหัสใด	รหัส D62 ให้เมื่อแพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า acute posthemorrhagic anemia ครับ ไม่ใช่ให้ coder เป็นคน พิจารณา การวินิจฉัยภาวะนี้เป็นดุลพินิจของแพทย์ ซึ่งหนังสือ Standard coding guidelines 2011 กำหนดให้ แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า acute posthemorrhagic anemia เมื่อมีปัจจัยครบ 3 อย่าง คือ (ก) ภาวะเลือดจาง (Hemoglobin <12 g % ในเพศหญิง หรือ <13 g % ในเพศชาย) (ข) Blood smear มีลักษณะ normocytic และ (ค) มีประวัติการ เสีย เลือดอย่างเฉียบพลัน เช่น ถ่ายดำ อาเจียนเป็นเลือด ไม่ได้พิจารณาว่ารักษาด้วยการให้เลือดหรือทานยา การ เสียเลือดจะ เกิดก่อนรับไว้หรือระหว่างรับไว้ก็ได้ ในกรณีที่แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่ามีเลือดออกมากขณะผ่าตัดจนต้องให้เลือดถือว่าเป็น ภาวะแทรกซ้อนของการรักษา ให้ใช้รหัส T81.0 Hemorrhage and hematoma complicating a procedure, not elsewhere classified ร่วมกับรหัสสาเหตุภายนอกในกลุ่ม Y60.- Unintentional cut, puncture, perforation or hemorrhage during surgical and medical care ซึ่งจะได้ข้อมูลที่สะท้อนเหตุการณ์ที่เกิดขึ้นได้ชัดเจนกว่าจะไป วินิจฉัยว่า Anemia	2
140	38	มาตรวจแผลผ่าตัดคลอด พบว่าแผลติดเชื้อ แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า Infected wound S/P C/S ให้รหัสอะไร	ให้รหัส O86.0 Infection of obstetric surgical wound ครับ รหัสนี้ใช้ได้กับทั้งแผลผ่าท้องคลอดและ แผลตัดฝีเย็บ และถ้าทราบเชื้อต้นเหตุอย่าลืมใส่รหัสเสริมในกลุ่ม B95 – B96 เพื่อระบุเชื้อต้นเหตุด้วย	2
141	39	มารดาตั้งครรภ์ 40 สัปดาห์ ระหว่างรอคลอดมี Fetal distress แพทย์ทำ Emergency cesarean section ผ่าตัดพบทารกเสียชีวิต แพทย์สรุปการวินิจฉัยของทารกว่า Stillbirth ควรให้สาเหตุการตายอะไร	ไม่ต้องให้สาเหตุการตาย เพราะทารกนี้เสียชีวิตก่อนคลอด ยังไม่ได้เกิดเลยครับ	2
142	40	คนไข้ท้อง 38 สัปดาห์ ลูกไม่ดิ้นมา 2 วัน แพทย์ตรวจพบว่าเด็กตายในท้อง วินิจฉัยว่า Dead fetus in utero (DFIU) ทำผ่าตัด Hysterotomy ควรให้รหัสอะไร	คุณหมออุตส่าห์วินิจฉัยชัดเจนว่า Dead fetus in utero ให้รหัส O36.4 Maternal care for intrauterine death ครับ ส่วนรหัสการผ่าตัดก็ตรงไปตรงมา ใช้ 68.0 Hysterotomy สงสัยท่านที่ถามคงจะไม่ยอมเปิดหนังสือ	2
143	41	มารดาตั้งครรภ์ 40 สัปดาห์ มีการรักษาด้วยยาต้านไวรัส HIV แพทย์นัดผ่าตัดคลอด และวินิจฉัยว่า Prophylaxis ให้รหัสโรคหลัก O98.7 ใช่หรือไม่	ก่อนให้รหัสคงจำเป็นต้องทบทวนข้อมูลให้ละเอียดว่าสตรีตั้งครรภ์รายนี้เป็น HIV disease หรือเป็นเพียง asymptomatic HIV infection เพราะมีการให้ยาต้านไวรัสทั้งสองกรณี การผ่าคลอดในกรณี HIV ไม่ได้เป็น prophylactic surgery เพียงแต่เชื่อว่าช่วยลดอัตราการติดเชื้อจากมารดาไปยังทารก และถ้าจะทำมักทำเมื่ออายุครรภ์ประมาณ 38 สัปดาห์ ไม่ใช่ 40 สัปดาห์ รหัส O98.7 ใช้เมื่อผู้คลอดเป็น HIV disease	2
144	42	เด็กแรกเกิด คลอดปกติ น้ำหนัก 3,000 กรัม แม่เป็นโรคติดเชื้อ รหัส P02, P04 แพทย์ไม่ได้ระบุอะไรเพิ่ม จะให้รหัสอะไรเป็นโรคหลัก	เข้าใจว่าผู้ถามยังไม่เข้าใจการใช้รหัสกลุ่ม P02.- Fetus and newborn affected by complications of placenta, cord and membranes และรหัสกลุ่ม P04.- Fetus and newborn affected by noxious influences transmitted via placenta and breast milk รหัสทั้งสองกลุ่มนี้ไม่ใช้เป็นรหัสโรคหลัก เพราะเป็นรหัสที่ช่วยเสริมข้อมูลว่าโรคหรือความผิดปกติที่พบในทารกแรกเกิดรายนี้ได้มาอย่างไร ดังนั้นรหัสโรคหลักคือรหัสของโรคหรือความผิดปกติที่พบครับ ถ้าแพทย์ไม่ได้ระบุก็ตีความได้ว่าทารกรายนี้ไม่มีโรคหรือความผิดปกติใดทั้งสิ้น แต่สงสัยจังเลยว่ารหัส P02 และ P04 ได้มาจากคำวินิจฉัยว่าอย่างไร งงครับ	2
145	43	ผู้ป่วยหลังคลอด 8 วัน ซ้อนท้ายรถมอเตอร์ไซด์ มี bleeing pervagina แพทย์สรุป Vagina tear(แผลฝีเย็บแยก) ใช้ รหัส O หรือ รหัส T	ใช้รหัส O90.1	2

148	46	ทารกคลอดครบกำหนดในโรงพยาบาล น้ำหนัก 2,200 กรัม กุมารแพทย์สรุปว่า Term SGA with perinatal depression ให้รหัสอย่างไร	ปัญหาของผู้ถามน่าจะอยู่ที่คำว่า “perinatal depression” ว่าหมายถึงอะไร ผู้ที่จะให้คำตอบได้ดีคือกุมารแพทย์ที่สรุป ตามความเห็นของผู้ตอบคำนี้น่าจะหมายถึงภาวะผิดปกติของแม่ ไม่ใช่ของทารกแรกเกิด เพราะคงไม่สามารถบอกความรู้สึกซึมเศร้าของทารกแรกเกิดได้ ผู้ตอบเดาว่าแม่ของทารกรายนี้มีภาวะซึมเศร้าในระหว่างตั้งครรภ์ใกล้คลอด คงจะทำให้กินไม่ได้นอนไม่หลับ ส่งผลให้ทารกมีน้ำหนักแรกเกิดน้อย ถ้าเป็นเช่นนี้จริงรหัสโรคหลักคือ P05.1 Small for gestational age รหัสโรคร่วมคือ P00.8 Fetus and newborn affected by other maternal conditions และ Z38.0 Singleton, born in hospital	2
149	47	แพทย์สรุปว่าผู้ป่วย incomplete abortion ทำหัตถการ evacuation ให้รหัสหัตถการอะไร	คำว่า evacuation ที่คุณหมอสรุป หมายถึงการนำ product of conception บางส่วนที่ตกค้างอยู่หลังการแท้ง ออกจากโพรงมดลูก ถ้าชิ้นส่วนที่ตกค้างมีขนาดใหญ่แพทย์อาจใช้วิธี “คีบ” ออกมา แทนที่จะขูดมดลูก แต่ส่วนใหญ่เมื่อคีบออกมาแล้วมักจะอดขูดตามไม่ได้ เพื่อให้มั่นใจว่าเอาออกมาหมด แพทย์หลายท่านจึงเรียกหัตถการนี้ว่า “evacuation and curettage” แทนที่จะเรียกว่า “dilatation and curettage” เพราะในผู้ป่วยที่แท้งไม่ครบปากมดลูกจะยังเปิดอยู่ ไม่ต้องขยายปากมดลูก สำหรับรหัสหัตถการใช้รหัสเดียวกัน คือ 69.02 Dilation and curettage following delivery and abortion	2
150	48	หญิงขายบริการมีเลือดออกหลังมีเพศสัมพันธ์รุนแรงกับผู้รับบริการที่โรงแรม แพทย์ตรวจพบ Laceration wound ใน Guidelines 2008 กล่าวไว้ว่า การมีเพศสัมพันธ์ที่มิใช่การข่มขืนใช้รหัสสาเหตุภายนอก X58.- Exposure to other specified factor แต่ Guidelines 2011 ไม่เขียนเรื่องนี้ กรณีนี้ใช้รหัส Y07.0 Other maltreatment syndrome by spouse or partner ได้หรือไม่	คำว่า Maltreatment syndrome by spouse or partner หมายถึงกลุ่มอาการได้รับการทารุณโดยคู่สมรสหรือ คู่เพศสัมพันธ์ (เพราะบางคนมิได้เป็นคู่สมรส เป็นแค่กิ๊ก) อาจจะเป็นการทารุณทางจิตใจ ทางร่างกาย เช่น การ ทรมานต่างๆ หรือการกระทำโดยมิชอบทางเพศ เช่น การมีเพศสัมพันธ์แบบวิตถาร ซึ่งผู้ถูกทารุณมิได้ยินยอมพร้อมใจ แต่ไม่รวมถึงการข่มขืน ดังนั้นรหัสสาเหตุภายนอกของการบาดเจ็บในคำถามนี้จึงมิใช่ Y07.0 แน่นอน เพราะเป็นเรื่อง ของการให้บริการทางเพศที่ไม่ใช่การทารุณ เพียงแต่อาจจะรุนแรงไปหน่อย และผู้รับบริการก็มิได้เป็นกิ๊กหรือคู่สมรส ของผู้บาดเจ็บจากการอภิปรายของผู้สันทัดกรณีสรุปว่า รหัสสาเหตุภายนอกของการบาดเจ็บที่เกิดจากเพศสัมพันธ์ที่มิใช่ การข่มขืนน่าจะเป็น W64.- Exposure to other and unspecified animate mechanical forces ซึ่งจะชัดเจน กว่ารหัส X58.- Exposure to other specified factor ครับ	2
151	49	รหัส P ใช้ในเด็กอายุเท่าไร สับสนระหว่าง perinatal period กับ newborn ถ้าเด็กอายุ 13 วันมาด้วยเรื่อง URI, oral ulcer และ omphalitis ให้รหัสอะไร	อย่าเพิ่งไปสับสนง่ายๆ ครับ รหัสที่ขึ้นต้นด้วยอักษร P อยู่ในบทที่ 16 ชื่อบทคือ “Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period” ซึ่งมี inclusion ต้นบทว่า “รวมภาวะที่เริ่มต้นในระยะปริกำเนิด แม้จะทำให้ทารกตายหรือป่วยภายหลัง” ถึงแม้ว่าระยะปริกำเนิดมีความหมายถึงอายุไม่เกิน 7 วันหลังคลอด แต่จะเห็นว่าชื่อของแต่ละรหัสล้วนมีคำว่า “Fetus and newborn” ทั้งนั้น คำจำกัดความของ “newborn” คือทารกแรกเกิด อายุไม่เกิน 28 วัน ดังนั้นรหัสอักษร P จึงใช้กับโรค “บางโรค” ที่เริ่มต้นในระยะปริกำเนิด แต่อาจทำให้ทารกป่วยหรือตายเมื่ออายุไม่เกิน 28 วันครับ เน้นว่า “บางโรค” เพราะจากตัวอย่างผู้ป่วยที่ถามมาจะมีรหัสที่ใช้อักษร P เพียงรหัสเดียวคือ P38 Omphalitis in newborn with or without mild hemorrhage	2
152	50	ผู้ป่วยหลังคลอดมาด้วยแผล episiotomy แยก ให้การรักษาโดยเย็บ episiotomy ซ้ำอีกครั้ง แต่แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า Wound infection ให้รหัสโรคหลัก O90.1 โรคร่วม Z48.0 หัตถการ 75.69 ถูกหรือไม่	หลักการสำคัญในการให้รหัสคือให้รหัสตามการวินิจฉัยที่แพทย์สรุป ถ้าเห็นว่าแพทย์สรุปไม่ถูกต้องให้ปรึกษาแพทย์ขอให้ทบทวนการสรุปใหม่ ถ้าปรึกษาไม่ได้หรือปรึกษาแล้วแพทย์ยืนยันไม่เปลี่ยนแปลงการสรุป ก็คงต้องให้รหัสไปตามนั้นครับ ในคำถามนี้ถ้าไม่สามารถขอให้แพทย์เปลี่ยนการวินิจฉัยได้คงต้องให้รหัส O86.0 Infection of obstetric surgical wound ส่วนรหัสโรคร่วมที่ให้ Z48.0 Attention to surgical dressing and sutures ผิดแน่นอน เพราะใช้กับการดูแลแผลที่ไม่พบความผิดปกติ ส่วนรหัสหัตถการ 75.69 ถูกต้องครับ เพราะรวม Secondary repair of episiotomy ด้วย	2
153	51	แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า DFIU (Deadfetus in utero) ทำผ่าตัด Hysterotomy ให้รหัสอะไร	รหัสสำหรับ DFIU คือ O36.4 Maternal care for intrauterine death ส่วนการนำเด็กที่เสียชีวิตแล้วออกมาโดย hysterotomy ใช้รหัสผ่าตัด 74.99 Other cesarean section of unspecified type ซึ่งรวมถึง Obstetrical hysterotomy ด้วย ส่วนรหัส 74.91 Hysterotomy to terminate pregnancy ใช้กับการยุติการตั้งครรภ์โดยทำ hysterotomy ใช้กับเด็กที่ยังไม่เสียชีวิตในครรภ์	2
154	52	ผู้ป่วยมาด้วยมีเลือดออกทางทวารหนัก มีประวัติมะเร็งปากมดลูกระยะที่ 3 รักษาโดยฉายแสงครบเมื่อ 5 เดือนก่อน แพทย์ตรวจพบว่ามีเลือดออกจากก้อนเนื้องอกใน rectum วินิจฉัยว่า Persistent squamous cell carcinoma of cervix with rectal metastasis รักษาโดยให้เลือด จะให้รหัส C53.1 หรือ K92.2 เป็นรหัสการวินิจฉัยหลัก	กรณีนี้ขอให้ท่านผู้ถามกลับไปอ่านหนังสือ Standard coding guidelines 2011 หน้า 62 อีกครั้ง จะพบว่าผู้ป่วยรายนี้รับไว้ด้วยปัญหาโรคแทรกซ้อนที่เกิดจากมะเร็ง คือมีเลือดออกทางทวารหนัก และโรคมะเร็งยังไม่หายไปไหนแม้จะรักษาครบแล้ว สังเกตได้จากการที่แพทย์ใช้คำว่า “persistent” ในคำวินิจฉัย และแพทย์ยังระบุด้วยว่าเลือดออกจากเนื้อมะเร็งที่ลุกลามไปที่ rectum ดังนั้นให้ใช้รหัสโรคมะเร็งปากมดลูกคือ C53.1 เป็นรหัสการวินิจฉัยหลักครับ 	2
155	53	ผู้มารับบริการตรวจครรภ์ที่ High-risk clinic ให้รหัสในกลุ่ม Z35.- Supervision of high-risk pregnancy ใช่หรือไม่	ยังเป็นความเข้าใจที่คลาดเคลื่อนครับ หลายโรงพยาบาลมีคลินิกพิเศษสำหรับดูแลครรภ์ “ที่มีปัญหา” เรียกว่าคลินิกตรวจครรภ์ความเสี่ยงสูง (High-risk ANC) ผู้มารับบริการที่คลินิกนี้ทุกรายคุณหมอทราบแล้วทั้งนั้นแหละว่ามีปัญหาอะไรบ้าง เช่น เบาหวาน ความดันโลหิตสูง ให้ใช้รหัสของปัญหาที่คุณหมอวินิจฉัยเป็นรหัสการวินิจฉัยครับ เช่น วินิจฉัยว่า gestational diabetes ก็ให้รหัส O24.4 โดยไม่ต้องให้รหัสในกลุ่ม Z35.- ร่วมด้วย รหัสในกลุ่ม Z35.- Supervision of high-risk pregnancy ใช้เฉพาะการดูแลการตั้งครรภ์ที่มี “ความเสี่ยง” แต่ยังไม่พบ “ปัญหา” เช่น ผู้มารับบริการมีประวัติ severe pre-eclampsia ในครรภ์ที่แล้ว แต่ครรภ์นี้ยังไม่พบว่ามีความผิดปกติอะไร ความดันโลหิตก็ไม่สูง ตรวจปัสสาวะก็ไม่พบโปรตีน อย่างนี้ให้รหัส Z35.2 Supervision of pregnancy with other poor reproductive or obstetric history แต่ถ้าเมื่อใดตรวจพบว่าครรภ์นี้ก็เกิดภาวะ severe pre-eclampsia ด้วย ถึงจะเปลี่ยนไปให้รหัส O14.1 Severe pre-eclampsia	2
263	97	แพทย์วินิจฉัย HORSE SHOE ABSCESS ให้รหัสเดียวกับ an rectal abscess (k61.2) หรือเปล่าค่ะ และทำผ่าตัด HENLEY OPERATION ให้รหัสผ่าตัดเป็น Anal fistulotomy (49.11) ได้หรือเปล่าค่ะ	ถ้าเป็น Horse shoe abscess ที่ก้น ก็ให้รหัสเหมือนกัน	3
156	54	แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า andropause ใช้รหัสอะไร หาไม่พบ	คำว่า andropause หรือที่บางท่านแปลแบบหลอกตัวเองว่า “ชายวัยทอง” ผู้ตอบมีความเห็นส่วนตัวว่าน่าจะแปลว่า “ชายวัยเสื่อม” จะเหมาะสมกว่า คำนี้มีที่มาเลียนจากคำว่า menopause ซึ่งหมายถึงวัยหมดประจำเดือนของเพศหญิง หมายถึงวัยที่สตรีสิ้นสุดความสามารถในการเจริญพันธุ์ ไม่สามารถมีบุตรได้อีก มีกำหนดเวลาค่อนข้างชัดเจน สำหรับสตรีไทยจะหมดประจำเดือนประมาณอายุ 47 – 48 ปี อาจหมดก่อนหรือหลังนี้ได้เหมือนกัน แต่ก็ไม่มากนักหรอก สำหรับเพศชายไม่มีประจำเดือน ไม่มีความชัดเจนว่าจะสิ้นสุดความสามารถในการเจริญพันธุ์เมื่อใด สุภาพบุรุษบางท่านสามารถมีบุตรได้แม้จะเกษียณอายุไปแล้ว จึงไม่มีกำหนดเวลาที่ชัดเจนของคำว่า andropause องค์การอนามัยโลกถือว่าภาวะนี้เป็นความเสื่อมตามปกติตามอายุขัยของการทำงานของต่อมเพศ (gonad) หรือลูกอัณฑะ ในการสร้างฮอร์โมนเพศชาย (androgen) ไม่ใช่โรคหรือความผิดปกติ จึงไม่มีรหัสจะให้ อย่าลืมว่า ICD เป็นการจัดหมวดหมู่และจัดทำรหัสสำหรับโรคและปัญหาสุขภาพที่พบในมนุษย์ ดังนั้นภาวะใดที่เป็นเรื่องปกติตามธรรมชาติ ไม่ใช่โรคหรือปัญหาสุขภาพย่อมจะไม่มีรหัสเป็นธรรมดา ไม่เชื่อท่านลองหารหัสสำหรับคำว่า menstruation สิครับว่ามีไหมแนะนำให้ปรึกษาแพทย์ขอให้เปลี่ยนการวินิจฉัยครับ	2
157	55	ปรึกษาแล้ว แพทย์เปลี่ยนคำวินิจฉัยจาก andropause เป็น Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) ให้รหัส E29.1 Testicular hypofunction ได้หรือไม่	คำว่า Late-onset hypogonadism ก็ไม่ต่างอะไรจากคำว่า andropause ท่านลองแปลความหมายสิครับ Hypogonadism แปลว่าภาวะที่ต่อมเพศ (คืออัณฑะ) ทำงานน้อยกว่าปกติ ส่วน Late-onset หมายถึงเริ่มต้นช้ากว่าที่ควร รวมความแล้วหมายถึงภาวะที่ต่อมเพศทำงานน้อยกว่าปกติที่เริ่มต้นช้ากว่าที่ควร เป็นเรื่องที่น่ายินดี น่าอนุโมทนาสาธุด้วยซ้ำ ไม่ใช่โรคภัยอะไร ไม่จำเป็นต้องรักษา ถ้าหากเป็น Early-onset hypogonadism จึงจะน่าตื่นเต้นรหัสในกลุ่ม E29.- Testicular dysfunction ใช้สำหรับการทำงานผิดปกติของอัณฑะ ทำให้สร้างฮอร์โมนเพศชายได้มากกว่าหรือน้อยกว่าที่ควรจะเป็น การที่อัณฑะของชายวัยชราจะทำหน้าที่สร้างฮอร์โมนเพศชายได้น้อยลง เป็นความเสื่อมไปตามธรรมชาติของสังขาร ที่พระท่านเทศน์สั่งสอนว่าสังขารทั้งหลายไม่เที่ยงหนอนั่นแหละ ไม่ถือว่าเป็นการทำงานผิดปกติครับ ถ้าภาวะนี้เกิดกับชายวัยรุ่นต่างหากจึงจะถือว่าผิดปกติ หรือในทางตรงข้าม คุณทวดวัยเก้าสิบจะมีระดับฮอร์โมนเพศพลุ่งพล่านจนต้องไขว่คว้าหาอีหนูมาผ่อนคลายก็ถือว่าผิดปกติเช่นกันสรุปว่าไม่มีรหัสอีกเหมือนกัน ไม่ทราบว่าคุณหมอของผู้ถามกำลังเล่นอะไรอยู่	2
158	56	แพทย์สรุปการวินิจฉัยว่า Criminal abortion ให้รหัส O05.9 ถูกต้องหรือไม่ 	ถูกต้องครับ แต่คุณหมอน่าจะวินิจฉัยได้ละเอียดกว่านี้นะครับ ว่าเป็นแบบ complete หรือ incomplete ถ้าสรุปได้เท่านี้ก็คงให้รหัสได้เท่านี้	2
159	57	ผู้ป่วยตั้งครรภ์สี่เดือน แพทย์รับไว้ทำแท้งหลังจากตรวจพบว่าทารกเป็น Down’s syndrome สรุปการวินิจฉัยว่าโรคหลัก คือ Trisomy 21 ให้รหัสอย่างไร	เข้าใจว่าคุณหมอคงสับสน ในกรณีนี้ Trisomy 21 น่าจะเป็นความผิดปกติของโครโมโซมของทารก ไม่ใช่ของมารดา จึงไม่ควรใช้เป็นคำวินิจฉัยในเวชระเบียนของมารดา ส่วนจะให้รหัสอย่างไรนั้นขอความกรุณาเปิดหนังสือ Standard coding guidelines 2011 หน้า 284 ครับ มีตัวอย่างให้ด้วย ขอให้คุณหมอสรุปใหม่ครับ	2
160	58	ผู้ป่วยอายุ 28 ปี มาด้วยอาการปวดท้อง แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า Midcycle pain ให้รหัส N94.8 Other specified conditions associated with female genital organs and menstrual cycle ใช่หรือไม่	ไม่ใช่ครับ เพราะคำวินิจฉัยนี้มีรหัสเฉพาะอยู่แล้ว คือ N94.0 Mittelschmerz คำนี้เป็นภาษาเยอรมัน ตรงกับภาษาอังกฤษว่า middle pain หรือ midcycle pain หมายถึงอาการปวดท้องน้อยของสตรีเป็นเวลานาน 2 – 3 วันในช่วงกลางของรอบประจำเดือน ซึ่งตรงกับช่วงเวลาที่ไข่สุก บางท่านจึงเรียกอาการปวดนี้ว่า “ovulation pain” อาจเกิดจากการขยายใหญ่ของฟองไข่ที่สุกเต็มที่ การตกไข่ผ่านผนังรังไข่ออกมา การหดรัดตัวของท่อนำไข่ในช่วงมีไข่ตก หรืออาจเกิดจากการระคายเคืองเยื่อบุช่องท้องโดยเลือดหรือของเหลวที่ออกมาจากฟองไข่เมื่อมีการตกไข่ รหัส N94.0 ห้ามใช้กับผู้ป่วยเพศชายครับ	2
161	59	มารับยาเม็ดคุมกำเนิดที่โรงพยาบาลนี้เป็นครั้งแรก แต่เคยรับที่อื่นมาก่อนแล้วหลายแผง จะให้รหัส Z30.0 หรือ Z30.4 	เข้าทำนอง “ใหม่ที่เรา แต่เก่าที่อื่น” ให้รหัส Z30.0 ครับ ไม่ต้องสนใจเรื่องราวในอดีต	2
162	60	ผู้ป่วยมารับการตรวจหลังแท้งบุตรตามแพทย์นัด ไม่มีอาการ ตรวจพบว่าปกติ แพทย์วินิจฉัยว่า Post abortion follow up ให้รหัสอะไรดี	ที่จริงแล้วกรรมวิธีของแพทย์การตรวจหลังแท้งบุตรกับการตรวจหลังคลอดบุตรแทบจะไม่แตกต่างกัน ปัญหาก็คือใน ICD-10 มีรหัสสำหรับการตรวจติดตามหลังคลอดคือ Z39.2 Routine postpartum follow-up แต่ไม่ยักมีรหัสเฉพาะสำหรับการตรวจหลังแท้ง ถ้าหากตรวจพบความผิดปกติก็ไม่ยาก ให้รหัสของความผิดปกติหรือโรคที่พบ แต่ถ้าไม่พบโรคหรืออะไรที่ผิดปกติคงต้องหันไปพึ่งรหัสในบทที่ 21 สักรหัส ที่ใกล้เคียงที่สุดเห็นจะเป็นรหัสในกลุ่ม Z09.- Follow-up examination after treatment for conditions other than malignant neoplasms ซึ่งผู้ให้รหัสคงต้องย้อนกลับไปดูว่าตอนที่แท้งบุตรนั้นแพทย์ให้การรักษาด้วยวิธีใด ถ้ามีการขูดมดลูกเพราะแท้งไม่ครบน่าจะใช้รหัส Z09.0 Follow-up examination after surgery for other condition เหมือนกับการตรวจติดตามหลังผ่าตัดทั่วไป เพราะการขูดมดลูกน่าจะนับเป็น surgery ได้อย่างหนึ่ง แต่ถ้าไม่ได้ขูดมดลูก ให้การรักษาตามอาการ (symptomatic treatment) แค่นอนพัก รับประทานยาแก้ปวด หรือยาบำรุง น่าจะใช้รหัส Z09.8 Follow-up examination after other treatment for other conditions คงพอกล้อมแกล้มไปได้ครับ	2
264	98	ผู้ป่วย granulation wound left leg เพื่อทำ debridement ควรให้รหัสอย่างไร?	S81.1 Open wound of leg	3
163	61	ผู้ป่วยครรภ์ที่ 2 ครรภ์แรกแท้ง มารับบริการตรวจครรภ์ ไม่พบความผิดปกติ ควรให้รหัส Z34.0 หรือ Z34.8	ผู้ถามก็ระบุมาเองว่าเป็นครรภ์ที่ 2 ไม่ว่าครรภ์แรกจะลงเอยด้วยการคลอดหรือการแท้ง ครรภ์นี้ก็ยังคงเป็นครรภ์ที่สองอยู่ดี ให้รหัส Z34.8 Supervision of other normal pregnancy ครับ	2

165	63	เด็กแรกเกิดน้ำหนักน้อย แพทย์สรุปว่า SGA มีโรคแทรกคือ neonatal sepsis อะไรทำให้ตาย	ผู้ตอบจะไปทราบได้อย่างไรล่ะครับ น่าจะไปถามคุณหมอที่ดูแลเด็กคนนี้ 	2

168	2	ผู้ป่วยหญิงไทย อายุ 55 ปี ประวัติเป็น Cataract right eye ได้ทำ ผ่าตัดใส่เลนส์ประมาณ 1 ปีที่แล้วที่ ร.พ.เอกชนแห่งหนึ่ง จากนั้น IOL dislocation right eye ได้ทำ PPV with Sclerafix – IOL right eye ที่ร.พ.เอกชนอีกแห่งหนึ่ง 2 เดือนก่อน หลังผ่าตัดมีปัญหา พบเป็น Secondary angle closure glaucoma right eye จาก posterior pushing mechanism วันนี้แพทย์นัดมา Admit เมื่อผ่าตัด แพทย์สรุป PDx.

169	3	จาก Guildline กรณีผู้ป่วย Aphakia จากอุบัติเหตุ ให้ใช้ T90.4 Sequelea of injury of eye and orbit External code ควรใช้รหัสอะไรดีค่ะหาก 1 กรณีอุบัติเหตุภายใน 1 ปี ควรให้รหัสตามสาเหตุ การบาดเจ็บหรือใช้ Sequelae ของการบาดเจ็บ 2 กรณีอุบัติเหตุหลังจาก 1 ปี ควรให้รหัสตามสาเหตุ การบาดเจ็บหรือใช้ Sequelae ของการบาดเจ็บ ดีคะ ตัวอย่างเช่น ผู้ป่วยหญิงไทย โดนไม้ดีดตา เมื่อประมาณ เดือนมกราคม 2553 แพทย์สรุปการวินิจฉัยโรคเป็น Traumatic cataract แพทย์ทำหัตถการ phagoemulsification and aspiration of cataract มาครั้งนี้ แพทย์นัดมาใส่เลนส์ แพทย์สรุป Aphagia หนูไม่ทราบว่า External code ควรให้รหัส W 20.xx หรือ Y86 ดีคะ 	ไม่น่าจะใช่ทั้งสองรหัส เพราะโรค aphakia ไม่ได้เกิดจากไม้ดีดตา หรือเป็น sequele อื่น ลองพิจารณา Y83.6 Removal of other organ (partial) (total) ดูนะครับ	3
170	4	ในกรณี Pdx Chondral lesion of femoral head with Labral tear and partial torn of Ligament teresและทำผ่าตัด Hip arthroscopy , debridement ligament teres and labrum ควรจะให้รหัส ICD อย่างไร	Chondral lesion นี้ไม่มีรหัสเฉพาะ น่าจะใช้ M94.8 Other specified disorders of of cartilage และ M67.8 Other specified disorders of synovium and tendon เป็นโรคร่วม	3

373	103	ตาม Standard Coding Guidelines 2011 มีการเพิ่มรหัส เช่น - O98.7 HIV Complicate Pregnamy Condition B20 B24 - เปลี่ยนแปลงการให้รหัสกลุ่ม CA ที่มารักษาโรคอื่น ๆ ที่ไม่ใช่ CA - Febrile Contusion จะมีการกำหนดให้ใช้เกณฑ์ใหม่ เมื่อไหร่ และสามารถส่งรหัสให้ สปสช. ได้	ใช้รหัสใหม่ได้ตั้งแต่เดือน เมษายน พ.ศ. 2555	4
374	104	สอบถามเกณฑ์การให้รหัส Foreign body อาจจะมีหลายที่เคยเจอ case แบบนี้ 1. กระดูกไก่ติดคอ มา รพ. ส่องกล้องไม่พบ FB 2. มี abrasion ที่ open esophagus ปัจจุบันให้รหัส T181 + w4499 เพราะใน guideline ไม่มี index foreign body เลยครับ	ส่องกล้องไม่พบใช้รหัส T18.1 ไม่ได้ พบมีแผลที่หลอดอาหารก็ให้รหัส S19.8 Superficial injury of cervical esophagus คู่กับ W44.99	4
375	105	อีกคำถาม ที่สงสัยคือ code palliative care มีน้ำหนักมากเหมือน 2 session ข้างต้นหรือไม่ เพราะมีผู้ป่วยที่ไม่มี plan ให้ยาเคมีแล้ว แต่รักษาตามอาการ มา admit for palliative care ต้องมาให้เลือด ให้น้ำเกลือ แก้electrolyte ซึ่งอยากทราบวิธีการลงรหัสที่เหมาะสมและตรงตามจริง	ดูตาม Guideline จะแนะนำให้แพทย์สรุปอาการที่รับไว้ palliative care	4
376	106	หากผู้ป่วยเป็นมะเร็งเต้านม 2 ข้าง ทำผ่าตัดในadmission เดียวกัน ลงรหัสอย่างไร เนื่องจากเป็นรหัสที่เหมือนกัน แม้แยกตามตำแหน่งquadrant แต่รหัส C50.- เหมือนกัน คิด DRG ใช้แค่รหัสเดียว ทั้งที่การรักษาก็ต้องใช้อุปกรณ์ 2 ชุด เช่น drain หรือ set ต่างๆ ไม่ทราบว่ามีรหัสแยกข้างหรือไม่ เคยเปิดใน ICD 10 ของ WHOในinternet มีcode ละเอียดถึงข้างของเต้านม แต่เปิดของประเทศไทยไม่มีแยกข้าง	การให้รหัส ICD ไม่มีวัตถุประสงค์ให้นำมาใช้คิดค่ารักษา จึงไม่มีรหัสบอกว่าเป็นโรคกี่ข้าง ถ้าอยากปรับการเบิก ค่าใช้จ่ายต้องไปปรึกษากองทุนให้ยกเลิกการจ่ายเงินตามรหัส กลับไปใช้การจ่ายเงินตามที่โรงพยาบาลเรียกเก็บ มิฉะนั้นจะ ไม่มีวันได้ตามที่ต้องการ	4

380	110	ตาม standard Coding Guidelines ฉบับล่าสุด หน้า350 Z53 ถ้ากรณี ผู้ป่วยนอก 1. ไม่ได้นัด ผู้ป่วยมาเอง แต่ไม่รอตรวจ ให้รหัส Z532 เป็นโรคหลักได้เลยหรือไม่ ถูกหรือไม่ 2.กรณี มีนัด แต่ผู้ป่วยไม่มา ให้รหัสอย่างไร ต้องเอาโรคเดิมเป็น โรคหลัก แล้ว เอา Z532 เป็นโรคร่วม ถูกหรือไม่ 3.กรณีที่ผู้ป่วยมีโรคเดิมที่มีทั้ง โรคหลักและโรคร่วมอีก 3 โรค แล้วมีเหตุผู้ป่วยไม่รอตรวจ ต้องให้โรคหลักและโรคร่วมอีก 3 แล้วให้ Z532 เป็นโรคร่วมที่ 4 ถูกต้องหรือไม่	ผู้ป่วย ไม่มา ไม่รอตรวจ ไม่ควรนับเป็นสถิติการรักษาผู้ป่วย OPD ไม่ต้องให้รหัส ไม่ต้องนับเป็นบริการของ OPD เพราะกรณีเหล่านี้ แพทย์ยังไม่ได้เขียนคำวินิจฉัย จึงไม่สามารถให้รหัสได้ 	4

416	1	เด็กเป็นไข้ แพทย์สรุปว่า RSV infection ควรให้รหัสใด	นี่เป็นปัญหาที่เกิดจากการสรุปไม่ละเอียด แล้วยังใช้อักษรย่อ เดาว่า RSV ย่อมาจากคำว่า Respiratory syncytial virus ซึ่งเป็นสาเหตุหนึ่งของการติดเชื้อในทางเดินหายใจของเด็กเล็ก ในรายนี้แพทย์ไม่ยักสรุปการวินิจฉัยว่าเกิดการติดเชื้อที่ส่วนใด สรุปแต่เพียงเชื้อต้นเหตุซึ่งใช้รหัส B97.4 Respiratory syncytial virus as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters ท่านผู้ถามคงทราบดีว่ารหัสนี้ไม่สามารถใช้เป็นรหัสโรคหลักได้ ต้องไปขอให้คุณหมอทบทวนการสรุปใหม่ครับ	4

418	1	Old CVA กับ Old ischemic stroke เหมือนกันหรือต่างกัน	ท่านผู้ถามควรซื้อ Medical dictionary ไว้ใช้สักเล่มนะครับ อักษรย่อ CVA ย่อมาจาก Cerebrovascular accident หมายถึงอุบัติเหตุของหลอดเลือดสมอง ซึ่งอาจแบ่งง่ายๆ เป็น 2 กลุ่ม คือ หลอดเลือดแตก (ทำให้มีเลือดออกในสมอง) กับหลอดเลือดตีบหรือตัน (ทำให้ขาดเลือดไปเลี้ยงเนื้อสมองบางส่วน) ส่วนคำว่า old แปลว่า “เก่า” คือเกิดมานานแล้ว ไม่ใช่เพิ่งเกิดใหม่ ดังนั้น Old ischemic stroke จึงเป็นชนิดย่อยชนิดหนึ่งของ old CVA	4

554	1	ใน Case ผู้ป่วยที่ทำผ่าตัด Total Knee Arthroplasty ใน Details of Operation แพทย์ผ่าตัดมีบันทึกถึงการให้ Antibiotic เช่น All prosthesis are fixed with antibiotic-cement  หรือในบางProcedure เช่น Arthroscopy of Knee with Debridement จะมีการบันทึกถึง การใช้ Kenacort injection ใน Op Note  ประเด็นที่อยากเรียนถาม เพื่อให้เจ้าหน้าที่ Coder มีหลักการการให้รหัสที่ถูกต้องเป็นแนวทางเดียวกัน คือ จำเป็นต้องให้รหัส 81.92 Injection of Therapeutic Substance into Joint or Ligament ด้วยหรือไม่ หรือในบางครั้งจะพบการใช้ Xylocaine or Marcaine ฉีดให้ผู้ป่วยในระหว่าง Procedure เช่นเดียวกับกรณีแรก   จำเป็นต้องให้รหัสการฉีดยานี้ด้วยหรือไม่	ถามอาจารย์จากราชวิทยาลัยแพทย์ออร์โธปิดิกส์แล้ว ยืนยันว่าการฉีดยาในรหัสหัตถการใดๆไม่ต้องให้รหัสเพิ่มเติม เพราะเป็นขั้นตอนที่ต้องทำในระหว่างการผ่าตัด นั้นๆอยู่แล้ว	3
555	1	ขอเรียนถามรหัสของโรค Ulnar Impaction Syndrome Left Wrist ว่าควรให้รหัสอะไรครับ	ไม่มีรหัสที่ตรงกับโรคนี้ คงเทียบเคียงแล้วให้เป็นรหัส M25.83 ครับ	3
556	1	ขอเรียนถามเรื่อง กรณีที่ผู้ป่วยเป็นมะเร็ง ในvisit ที่มาทำ Chemotherapy มีการทำ Procedure Port A Cath Insertion (ใส่ในห้องผ่าตัด) ร่วมด้วย การเลือกรหัสหัตถการที่จะถือว่าเป็น Main Operation/Procedure นั้น สำหรับ Visit ระหว่าง การให้ Chemotherapy  (ICD-9-CM  = 99.25) กับ Port A Cath Insertion (ICD-9-CM = 86.07) นั้นจะให้อะไรเป็น Main ค่ะ	เรื่อง chemotherapy จริงๆแล้วไม่ถือเป็นหัตถการ เป็นเรื่องการให้ยารักษามากกว่า ดังนั้นในรายนี้ ต้องใช้ Catheter insertion เป็นหัตถการหลักครับ	3
557	1	ขอเรียนถามรหัสหัตถการ Suture Achilles Tendon (Left) with Short Leg Slab รหัสของ Short Leg Slab  93.53 ต้องให้รหัสหรือไม่ค่ะ	ใส่รหัส 93.53 เป็นรหัสที่สองครับ ระวังอย่าไปใส่เป็น main operation เพราะการใส่เฝือกสำคัญน้อยกว่า	3
558	1	Case ผู้ป่วยทำผ่าตัด Augmentation and Mastopexy Both Breasts ไปเมื่อ 2 วันก่อนและกลับมา Admit ครั้งนี้ด้วยเรื่อง Pain after Surgery ให้ Morphine 4 mg IV at left dorsal metacarpal vein ผู้ป่วยนอนโรงพยาบาล 1 วันแพทย์สรุป Discharge Summary ดังนี้ครับ Principal Diagnosis :   Pain after Surgery\r\nขอเรียนถามว่าจะให้รหัสในแบบที่ 1 หรือ แบบที่ 2 หรืออาจารย์มีข้อคิดเห็นเป็นอย่างอื่นครับ\r\nแบบที่ 1.  T81.8, Y81.2 หรือ แบบที่ 2. T81.8, Y83.1 	ถ้าให้รหัสเป็นกลุ่ม T81 มันจะหมายถึง complication หลังการผ่าตัด ซึ่งในกรณีนี้ แพทย์ยังไม่ได้บอกว่าเกิด complication ขึ้นมาแล้ว น่าจะให้รหัสกลุ่ม R มากกว่า เช่น R52.9	3
559	289	เด็กหลังคลอดที่แพทย์นัดมา Follow up ใช้รหัสอะไรคะ	ต้องถามกลับว่าแล้วคุณหมอนัดมาทำอะไรล่ะครับ  หรือแค่คิดถึงกันอยากจะขอเห็นหน้า  ถ้านัดมาตรวจสุขภาพเด็กตามปกติและตรวจไม่พบว่ามีอะไรผิดปกติ  ก็ให้รหัส  Z00.1  Routine child health examination  แต่ถ้าพบความผิดปกติก็ให้รหัสของความผิดปกตินั้น	2
560	289	Artificial rupture of membrane รหัส 73.01 กับ 73.09 ใช้ต่างกันยังไงคะ แล้วใช้ในกรณี augmentation การคลอดได้รึไม่คะ	ชื่อรหัสก็ต่างกันชัดเจนแล้วนี่ครับ  73.01  Induction of labor by artificial rupture of membranes  คือการชักนำให้เจ็บครรภ์โดยการเจาะถุงน้ำคร่ำ  แปลว่าผู้คลอดยังไม่เจ็บครรภ์  แต่คุณหมอต้องการให้เธอเจ็บครรภ์เสียที  เลยเจาะถุงน้ำคร่ำ  เพื่อชักนำให้เจ็บครรภ์\r\n\tส่วน  73.09  Other artificial rupture of membranes  คือการเจาะถุงน้ำคร่ำในกรณีอื่นนอกเหนือจาก 73.01  เช่นในกรณี augmentation of labor ที่ถามมา  ซึ่งหมายความว่าผู้คลอดเจ็บครรภ์เองแล้ว  แต่ยังไม่ดีพอ  อาจจะเบาเกินไป  หรือห่างเกินไป  คุณหมอก็เลยเจาะถุงน้ำคร่ำเพื่อให้การเจ็บครรภ์มีคุณภาพดีขึ้น\r\n	2
